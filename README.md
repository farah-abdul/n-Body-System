# n-Body-System
This project models three-body and N-body orbital systems using numerical integration techniques to simulate gravitational interactions and orbital trajectories.   Developed as a group project as part of Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics at The Ohio State University

---

## Purpose
To numerically solve Newtonâ€™s equations of motion for multiple gravitational bodies and visualize resulting trajectories in 2D and 3D.  
The project demonstrates how integration accuracy and step size influence orbital stability and energy conservation in complex dynamical systems.

---

##  Features
- N-body gravitational simulation for arbitrary mass systems  
- Implemented **Rungeâ€“Kutta 4** solver  
- Energy and momentum conservation checks for validation  
- Configurable initial conditions (masses, positions, velocities)  
- 2D and 3D trajectory visualization using MATLAB plotting functions

> Example output below shows a simulated three-body system illustrating gravitational perturbations and orbital resonance patterns.
